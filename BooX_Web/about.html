					Snap and Sell Technology
				</span></h3>
				<p>					
			         Jaka Krajnc is the founder of the Snap and Sell Technology.
				His main problem when he wanted to sell some old books and notes was the lenghty process that came with it.
				He took his phone and had an immediate thought. Why could not he just take a picture and let the computer do the work for him?
			         This is the moment Snap and Sell idea had been born. It works just as it says: take a picture with you phone or choose it from your gallery, the computer will automatically recognize the text needed to create an ad. You are two clicks away from the actual ad being published.
